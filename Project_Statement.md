# **Web Activity Tracker with AI Agent System**

## **Project Overview**

This project is an **AI-Powered Activity Tracker** that monitors user activity data and provides intelligent agents that can answer natural language questions about digital behavior patterns.

**Core Components:**
- **Data Collection**: Automated web browsing and GitHub activity tracking
- **AI Agents**: Intelligent agents that understand natural language questions
- **SQL Generation**: Automatic conversion of questions to database queries
- **Intelligent Responses**: Contextual answers framed using extracted data

## **Main Plan: AI Agent System**

### **Problem Statement**

In today's digital world, understanding our online behavior and development patterns is crucial for productivity and self-improvement. However, manually analyzing web browsing history, GitHub activity, and development metrics is time-consuming and often incomplete.

**The Challenge:**
- No automated way to track and analyze web activity patterns
- Difficulty in understanding development productivity trends
- Lack of intelligent insights from historical data
- Manual data analysis is inefficient and error-prone

**The Solution:**
An intelligent system that automatically collects data and provides AI-powered agents that can answer natural language questions about your digital activity patterns.

### **How It Works**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Continuous collection of web and GitHub activity data
2. **Question Processing**: User asks natural language questions
3. **Query Generation**: AI agents convert questions to SQL queries
4. **Data Extraction**: Execute queries against the database
5. **Answer Framing**: Generate intelligent, contextual responses

### **Example User Interactions**
- *"How much time did I spend on social media last week?"*
- *"What are my most productive coding hours?"*
- *"Which repositories am I most active in?"*
- *"Show me my web browsing patterns for the last month"*
